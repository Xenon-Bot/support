content: |
  After buying Xenon Premium on Patreon please join our [Discord server](<https://xenon.bot/discord>) and connect your Discord account to Patreon in your [profile settings at Patreon](<https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps>). 

  You should now be able to see a channel called <#633228936893038593> on our Discord server. This channel contains information on how to invite and use Xenon Premium. There is also a <#633228955096449035> channel dedicated to Xenon Premium users.

  If you still don't see the channel please try to disconnect and reconnect your Discord account in your [profile settings at Patreon](<https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps>).
  If this doesn't help and you aren't able to access the premium features please write us a message on Patreon or send an email to `contact@xenon.bot`.
